		 In the essay, “As We May Thing”, Vannevar Bush urges scientists to explore a new path to store knowledge. 
		He argues that back then, scientists have been using their knowledge for war work. But now it is time for 
		scientists to take a step forward and use their knowledge to extend “the power of his mind” rather than 
		the “man’s physical power”. Bush argues that extending “the power of his mind" is crucial because it makes
		our storing of knowledge more accessible. Developing instruments properly will give people access to ages 
		of knowledge. Currently, many modern powerful instruments have been invented for such purpose. The list of 
		instruments includes photography, cathode ray tubes and many more. However, Bush urges that storing the knowledge 
		is not enough. All the information collected should also be consulted. Overall, Bush’s excerpt lay the
		foundation for scientists to pursue a new direction: the web. However, when the excerpt was published
		in 1945, the web has not been developed yet. So, it was really intriguing to know how Bush has predicted 
		how powerful and useful the web could be.

		 Tim Berners Lee developed the web in 1989. In “Long live the Web”, Lee informs us that it is 
		essential to follow the principles of the web. As the developer of the web, he reminds us that
		the web is a public resource for everyone used to serve humanity. However, it has been
		threatened by totalitarian governments to invade the privacy of others and used for other 
		negative purposes. To stop the web from being threatened, it makes the many principles of the
		web to be more valuable. The main principle of the web is universality. This means anyone 
		should be able to access the web from anywhere and anything can be put on the web. This brings 
		up a question: how does censorship challenge this principle? The other principal Lee brings up
		is decentralization. It is the freedom to make any page you want without asking for permission.
		The other principle is net neutrality. Lee urges us all to uphold the principles of the web so 
		that we keep the web going and it becomes a tool for future innovation. 
 	  </p>
	  <p> Some thoughts: After reading and analyzing both excerpts, both Bush and Lee indicate that
		 the web is necessary to pave the path for the next generation of innovation. However, if 
		 Lee states that the web is being threatened, who is at fault since the web “belongs to 
		 everyone”. Also the principles that the Lee mentioned in the excerpt about universality. 
		 If anything can be posted on the web, can’t the web be also a dangerous platform?
		 What are the limitations to the “anything” that can be posted? </p>
