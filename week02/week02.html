		   <h3> <em>"The purpose of publicity is to make the spectator
			marginally dissatisfied with his present way of life. Not with
			the way of life of society, but with his own within it. It
			suggests that if he buys what it is offering, his life will become better." </em></h3>

			<p>In this final episode of Way of Seeing, John Berger explores the role of publicity in our lives. 
				One definition of publicity that struck out to me is when he said publicity is something that appeals 
				to a way of life we aspire to but we have yet achieved. It plays upon our fear and anxiety. The purpose 
				of publicity is also to suggest that if we buy what the publicity is offering, his life will also become better. 
				This makes me think of all the modern advertisements that are on Times Square Billboard, Youtube and the Subway. 
				These advertisements that all of us perceive everyday subconsciously influences us as consumers. We go to buy something
				that we think will make us happy as the lives shown on the advertisement. My favorite part of the episode is when Berger 
				compares the purpose of publicity to the purpose of oil paintings. It shows that even back then people have been trying to
				give themselves a feeling of a false positive. However, what is different is that back then the images were not used to
				subconsciously persuade people to do something. Instead, the oil paintings were feeding the self-worth of the owner. 
				The paintings allowed the owner to show off their possessions and their social status. 
				My question comes in:
				Why do we continue to give ourselves a false sense of happiness through images? Also what shaped the development of art from wealth self advertisement 
				to publicity?
