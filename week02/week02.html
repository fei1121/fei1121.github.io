        In Episode 1 of Ways of Seeing, John Berger talks about how through the invention of cameras, 
        images are able to “travel” to us rather than before. Cameras are able to capture a painting and reproduce the painting to a wide array of audiences. 
        However, Berger states that there comes a great loss with this invention: authenticity. Paintings that are now shown in film loses its original meaning 
        because we are no longer watching it at the place and atmosphere where it once resided in. One very interesting point Berger brings up is that now paintings
        become “transmittable”.  The power of cameras allows people to use images to make their own arguments which are apart from their original meaning. 
        This reminded me of how governments use renowned images as propaganda to enforce particular political beliefs. Not only do governments use images for
        their own stance, we do it too! In modern society, memes have become a powerful and common tool in which people tweak powerful images to transcend 
        a message. I’ve to say that during my countless hours on social media, I’ve seen many memes done to Mona Lisa. Although it is a humorous way to communicate 
        a message, I’ve never realized that having reproducible images in our lives made us lose the “authenticity” that the painting once had. Although Berger 
        argues that we also lose the silence and stillness, I want to argue that there are also many benefits to the invention of cameras. I think the most 
        important benefit is that interest in art is not only related to privileged education. It has also inspired many people in the minority to pursue the path.
